Access Modifiers in Java:
restriction levels:
1) Private
2) Default
3) Protected
4) Public

Rules:
1) we should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data
and the methods of your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform
sanity checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might
misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access
the data.
2) we can't use access modifiers with local variables

make methods public and variables private!
