al classes in Java:
are the classes with abstract keyword
we use abstract classes to achieve abstraction.
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to end user
Advantages:
    1) reduces the complexity.
    2) improves the maintainability.
    3) can also enforce rules utp to a certain limit.
Disadvantages:
    1) classes get tightly coupled
class Dog {
String name;
//concrete class
}
public class abstract Phone {
String make;
String model;
}
Rules:
Abstract classes can have all the things that regural classes do but we
can't create their objects directly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either provide
the implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract.
1) we can't have final and abstract keyword with method at the same time
2) we can't have static and abstract keyword with method at the same time
3) abstract keyword with fields not allowed
