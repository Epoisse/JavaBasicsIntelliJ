Encapsulation
is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing the getter setter methods

Benefits:
Better control over the data and security.

Collection Framework:
 is a collection of interaces and classes which have many methods to store and manipulate the data

Collections
1. Dynamic in size
2. They have built-in mehtods to manipulate the data
3. Collections framework does not work with the primitive data types.
   we have to use the wrapper classes
4. When we convert the primitive data type to non primitive we call it boxing
Boxing:
int num=10;
Integer wrapper=new Integer(num); // boxing
Integer wrapper=num; // autoboxing

Double d=new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue(); // un-boxing
double num4=d; // auto un-boxing

In Java when we make a class inherit from another class we are already doing multiple
inheritance because Object class is automatically inherited for all the classes
