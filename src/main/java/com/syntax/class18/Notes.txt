Access modifiers:
are keywords that defines from where a certain variable method class constructor or interface can
be accessed.
There are four types of access in Java that we can define using three keywords
1) private 2) protected 3) public

Types of access are 4
1) private 2) default (not a keyword) 3) protected 4) public

private - when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes
these can only be accessed within that class

default - when we don't use any of the keywords access is applied by Java to those
variables methods or classes. Which means these things can only be accessed from the same package

protected - when protected access is applied class members (variables methods etc) can be
accessed from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance

public - means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project
