List should be used when we have to store single element as a collection
1. maintain the order
2. allows duplicated
3. they are dynamic in size

ArrayList
When most of the operations(70-80%) are storing new data at the end of the list
and reading data no manipulation of data

LinkedList
When most of the operations are storing new data in-between or at the start of the list
then we should go with the linkedList

Sets
 No duplicates

HashSet
does not maintain the order
the fastest for retrieval and retrieval

LinkedHashSet
maintain insertion order
insertion is slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet
retrieval is slowest
