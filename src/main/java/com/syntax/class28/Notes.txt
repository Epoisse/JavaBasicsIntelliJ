Wrapper classes:
they are object types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes we
get all the benefits of classes and objects for example we can have methods.
Also generics works with only classes.
Boxing in wrapper classes:
boxing happens when convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
int num=10;
Integer num2=new Integer(num)
unboxing happens when we convert wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
Integer num2=new Integer(10)
int num=num2.intValue();
Integer num=10; // autoBoxing
int num2=num; // autoUnboxing

List (it is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by tow classes ArrayList LinkedList

1) We can store the duplicate values in lists
2) Insertion order is maintained

ArrayList

If most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing the position
of data them we should go with ArrayList

LinkedList

When most of the operations are related to changing the possition of data or related to data shifting
then we should go with LinkedList
