Collections Framework in Java:
 is collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way.
 1) ArrayList
    - This class has many built-in methods like ass() remove() clear() etc.
    - Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

    ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList - name of the class
    <> - diamond operator we specify the data type

 Wrapper class
 byte=>Byte
 short=>Short
 int=>Integer
 double=>Double
 char=>Character

 why wrapper classes
 - we get built-in methods
 - a lot of frameworks don't support primitives
 when to use primitive
 - when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as
 compared to wrapper
 - performance
 when to use Wrapper
 - when we care about our ease
