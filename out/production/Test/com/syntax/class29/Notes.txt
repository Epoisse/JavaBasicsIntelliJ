Set

is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes
- HashSet
- LinkedHashSet
- TreeSet

Properties of Set:
    all the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
    does not maintain the insertion order
    it is the fastest in all Sets
    most widely used Set

LinkedHashSet:
    maintains the insertion order
    slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

TreeSet:
    sorts the data in natural order. For number in increasing order and for
    it is slowest when it comes to store the data being sorted always use HashSet
    if we need the insertion order we don't have much choice we have to use LinkedHashSet but if we don't care
    about the insertion order we can compare it with TreeSet

    LinkedHashSet              vs   TreeSet
    Insertion is not slow           Slowest insertion
    Retrieval is super slow         Retrieval is moderated (Slower than HashSet but faster Linked)
