Maps in Java:

Its a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs
1. Searching is efficient
2. We can use any types of keys like Double String char etc. We are not restricted to int
based natural indexes.

There are many types of maps but mostly used are:
1. HashMap 2. LinkedHashMap 3. TreeMap 4. HashTable (Old)

HashMap:
- is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data
- insertion order is not maintained
- the most widely used map

LinkedHashMap:
- maintains insertion order
- insertion speed the same as HashMap
- retrieval speed is the slowest one

TreeMap
- data is sorted based on the natural order
- insertion speed is the slowest because of the sorting

HashTable
- thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same
time from multiple CPU cores but because of thread safety feature it is also very slows
